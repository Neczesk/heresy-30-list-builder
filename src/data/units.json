The design itself was created in response to a request for a war machine that could rapidly deploy such fortress-breaking firepower to the battle line at speeds greater than the slow crawl of the Imperial Army's heavy batteries. Many observers have labelled it as little more than an 'upscaled' Vindicator in design, and while in some ways this may be true, few can deny its utterly brutal effectiveness in action.",

It was not without acrimony that the Forge Lords agreed to the Emperor's demand for a Legion tank to be created that utilised this weapon. The effort of constructing practicable numbers of super-heavy tanks around the volkite carronade is considered well worth the expenditure in resources required, for multiple targets are struck down by its ravening beam before even a portion of its energy is dissipated.",
